Massive MIMO is seen as the way forward in enhancing the transmission rate and user capacity in 5G wireless. The potential of massive MIMO system lies in the ability to almost always realize multiuser channels with near zero mutual coupling. Coupling factor reduces by 1\/2 for each doubling of transmit antennas. In a high bit rate massive MIMO system with <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m<\/mml:mi><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:math> base station antennas and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:math> users, downlink capacity increases as <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">log<\/mml:mi><\/mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2<\/mml:mn><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:msub><\/mml:mrow><mml:mo>\u2061<\/mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m<\/mml:mi><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:math> bps\/Hz, and the capacity per user reduces as <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M4\"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">log<\/mml:mi><\/mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2<\/mml:mn><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:msub><\/mml:mrow><mml:mo>\u2061<\/mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:mrow><\/mml:math> bps\/Hz.

For low bit rate transmission, time sharing achieves the capacity as much as power sharing does. System capacity reduces as channel coupling factor increases. Interference avoidance or minimization strategies can be used to achieve the available capacity in such scenarios.
